[@graue](http://twitter.com/graue) started a music streaming app intended to
run on a personal server. Since we both had the same idea, we started tackling
bits and pieces of functionality at a time.

It's in a very earlier stage and currently uses the
[flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) python framework along with
[backbone](http://backbonejs.org), underscore,
[handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) and html5 audio
