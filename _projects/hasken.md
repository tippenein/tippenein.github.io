title: Personal Document Store (Hasken)
name: Hasken
---

There are 3 goals of this project:

- use acid-state locally to provide a searchable (tags) document store.
- provide a service daemon which periodically syncs with a personal server.
- encrypt the data client side and store raw data on the server.

As of now, I'm using haskell to provide the client side searching and the last
2 goals are being worked on.
