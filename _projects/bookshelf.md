This is more like a suite of projects to attempt a nicer interface for viewing ebook collections.

The first part is functional: The [ebook_library](https://github.com/tippenein/ebook_library) gem is for exporting a local collection of ebook metadata to a json dump.

The output of the gem is used to display your ebook collection in a more friendly way. This project ([bookshelf](https://github.com/tippenein/bookshelf)) is written mostly in Elm thusfar, but I'm not convinced of the architecture yet so it's TBD.
