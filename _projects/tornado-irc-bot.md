Using [Tornado Async](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) library I built up
an irc bot for general use. It comes with
[imgup](http://www.github.com/tippenein/imgup) which I wrote as a separate
project to anonymously upload images to imgur and spit back the url. 
You can add any functionality to the modules directory and use it based on patterns chosen in ircbot.py.
It seems to handle requests very well and it comes with an `!animal` module so you can get a picture of a cute animal anytime you want!
