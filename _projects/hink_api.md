Hink is a project that seeks to create an easily configurable API for
notes, links, images, or whatever you want to store on your vps/AWS/whatever.
Originally this project was written with Node and mongo but I decided shortly
after that writing more javascript than you have to is a bad idea. Now it uses
rails-api and postgres and cut down the amount of code by at least 50 percent.
