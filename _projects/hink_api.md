Hink is a project that seeks to create an easily configurable API for
notes, links, images, or whatever you want to store on your vps/AWS/whatever.
Originally this project was written with Node and mongo but I decided shortly
after that writing more javascript than you have to is a bad idea. Now it uses
`rails-api` and `postgres` while significantly cutting down the amount of code used.
