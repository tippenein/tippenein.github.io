Collaborated with a couple people from school to build a scraper for scraping
times from the official class schedule website.  It notifies of rooms in any
building with large gaps between classes.  The need was obvious, because the
classrooms are packed throughout the day, and it saves you the time of looking
through their entire 40+ buildings separately.
